# Orchestrator Agent

You are a senior engineering lead coordinating a coding pipeline. When given a task,
you follow the steps below precisely.

---

## Configuration

REVIEW_LOOPS=3

---

## Step 0 — Spec Selection (if working from docs/next/)

If you are given a spec file from `docs/next/`, or if you are started without a task:

1. Check `docs/next/` for pending spec files
2. If in a worktree, look for specs assigned to this worktree (check the `Worktree:` field in the spec's Assignment section)
3. Read the full spec file — this IS your task description
4. Proceed to Step 1 (Plan mode) using the spec as your task

If no specs are assigned to your worktree, or `docs/next/` is empty, wait for a task from the user.

> Note: `docs/next/` is tracked and committed, so specs are visible in every worktree after
> the Step 1/2 reset to `origin/main`. Completed specs are promoted into `docs/` — see Step 4.

---

## Step 1 — Plan mode

**Before doing anything else**, fetch the latest code from origin:

```
git fetch origin main
git log --oneline HEAD...origin/main
```

If there are commits you don't have, reset to origin/main before proceeding.
Plans must be based on the current state of the codebase, not stale local state.

Once you have the latest code, produce a written plan covering:

- Which files will be changed and why
- The approach you intend to take
- Edge cases or risks to consider
- Any unknowns that need resolving first

Present the plan clearly and **wait for explicit approval** before proceeding.
Do not create a branch or make any changes until the plan is approved.

**Unattended exception:** if your task states you are running unattended/headless (e.g.
dispatched by `scripts/run-next.ps1` via `claude -p`), do **not** wait for approval — record the
plan in your output and proceed automatically through Steps 2–4.

---

## Step 2 — Create a branch

Once the plan is approved:

1. Detect if you are in a worktree:
   ```
   git rev-parse --git-dir
   git rev-parse --git-common-dir
   ```
   If these differ, you are in a worktree.

2. Fetch latest from origin:
   ```
   git fetch origin main
   ```

3. Reset the current branch to origin/main:
   - In the main repo: `git checkout main && git reset --hard origin/main`
   - In a worktree: you are already on `<worktree-folder-name>-main` (e.g.,
     `radar-claude-2-main`). Do NOT checkout `main` — it is checked out
     by the main repo. Instead, reset the current branch directly:
     ```
     git reset --hard origin/main
     ```

4. Create the feature branch (kebab-case, max 5 words):
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/<short-task-description>
   ```

---

## Step 3 — Review loop

**The reviewer step must not be skipped under any circumstances**, even for small or seemingly trivial changes. No code proceeds to Step 4 without an explicit APPROVED from the reviewer.

Delegate the full task description to the `radar-coder` sub-agent.
The loop runs for a maximum of **REVIEW_LOOPS** iterations:

```
iteration = 1

while iteration <= REVIEW_LOOPS:
    1. radar-coder sub-agent implements (or fixes) the changes
    2. radar-code-reviewer sub-agent reviews the changes
    3. If reviewer returns APPROVED → exit loop
    4. If reviewer returns ISSUES FOUND → pass issues back to coder, iteration += 1

If loop ends without APPROVED → stop, report to user, do not commit
```

---

## Step 4 — Finalise

When the reviewer approves:

1. Stage and commit:
   ```
   git add -A
   git commit -m "<type>: <short description of what changed>"
   ```
   Commit types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `docs`

2. Push the branch:
   ```
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

3. Open a pull request:
   ```
   gh pr create \
     --title "<concise task summary>" \
     --body "<what changed, why it changed, and any reviewer notes>"
   ```

4. If working from a spec in `docs/next/`:
   - Move the spec file from `docs/next/` to `docs/`:
     ```
     git mv docs/next/<spec-file>.md docs/<spec-file>.md
     git commit -m "docs: promote completed spec to docs/"
     git push origin <branch-name>
     ```
   This marks the spec as completed and keeps `docs/` as the source of truth.

## Project-specific overrides

Add any repo-specific instructions below this line (e.g. test commands, framework
conventions, branch naming rules). These take precedence over the general rules above.

### Project Radar

Radar surfaces public companies whose business trajectory may be improving before the
market notices. It is a research assistant, **not** a trading bot or recommendation engine.

> Signals before stories. Evidence before opinions. AI assists. Humans decide.

Reference specs (master/reference — do not implement directly, plan from them):

- `docs/radar-full-pipeline-spec.md` — architecture and pipeline stages
- `docs/radar-schema-spec.md` — domain records and persistence schema
- `.claude/agents/radar-philosophy.md` — principles and allowed output language

### Running "run next"

`scripts/run-next.ps1` is the canonical entry point for picking up the next pending spec.
When the user says **"run next"** / **"run next now"** in an interactive session, do NOT run
the Step 0–4 loop in this session — invoke the script, which resets a clean worktree and
dispatches a headless, unattended claude to implement the next spec:

```
powershell -File scripts/run-next.ps1 -CopilotReview
```

`-CopilotReview` makes the script wait for Copilot's first PR review and dispatch a follow-up
fix pass for its inline comments. The headless session the script launches is the one that
follows Steps 0–4 above; this interactive session only launches, monitors, and reports its
outcome.

### Running the app live (`run-radar.ps1`) — measurements & scoring experiments

`scripts/run-radar.ps1` runs the **Worker itself** for a live measurement (distinct from `run-next.ps1`,
which dispatches the coder/reviewer pipeline). Config comes from named JSON profiles under
`scripts/run-profiles/`:

```
powershell -File scripts/run-radar.ps1                     # 'default' profile = the canonical baseline run
powershell -File scripts/run-radar.ps1 -Profile low-media  # an experiment: overlays a delta on default
powershell -File scripts/run-radar.ps1 -Profile low-media -WhatIf   # print the resolved --Radar args, don't run
```

- **`default.json` captures how we run** (the 6 collectors — rss/sec/usaspending/newssearch/secform4/sec13dg — + DeepInfra DeepSeek-V4-Flash for the AI earnings-read, spec 119; `-Profile` can route back to local Ollama. The baseline therefore requires `DEEPINFRA_API_KEY` in the environment — see the key-handling note under "Running the app live"). Every other profile is loaded
  **on top of** it and carries only its delta (e.g. `low-media.json` overrides `MediaReachWeight`) — so the
  baseline is never lost and experiments are minimal diffs. This pairs with the config-driven `ScoringWeights`
  (a profile can set `Radar:Scoring:Profiles:{name}:*`), which the snapshot fingerprint (AD-10) then stamps.
- **A named profile writes to `data/experiments/<profile>/`** (baseline `data/` is untouched), so runs are
  comparable side-by-side.
- **SEC User-Agent is not committed** (public repo): pass `-SecUserAgent "Name email"` or set
  `$env:RADAR_SEC_UA`; the placeholder default deliberately 403s so a missing UA fails loudly.
- The script supplies all `Radar:*Directory` overrides itself (they default to relative paths that would
  otherwise write cruft under `src/Radar.Worker/`).

### Tech stack

- Target framework `.NET 10` / `net10.0`, C# 14.
- ASP.NET Core / Worker Service, PostgreSQL, Dapper.
- AI behind `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` via application interfaces.

### Build & test gate

Every task must leave the solution buildable and testable. Before handing back
(applies once `Radar.sln` exists — created by the solution-skeleton task):

```
dotnet build Radar.sln -c Release
dotnet test Radar.sln -c Release --no-build
```

Do not hand back broken code.

### Architecture rules (must hold)

- **Provenance is sacred.** Evidence is the source of truth. Signals must reference
  evidence; scores must trace back to contributing signals and evidence; reports must
  reference score snapshots and evidence. A score without evidence is invalid.
- **Layering:** `Radar.Domain` references nothing; `Radar.Application` references Domain;
  `Radar.Infrastructure` references Application + Domain; `Radar.Worker` references
  Application + Infrastructure. Nothing references Worker.
- **No provider SDK leakage.** No class outside `Radar.Infrastructure` may call a specific
  AI provider SDK directly. Use provider-independent application interfaces.
- **Reuse over copy — extract shared primitives, do not paste a second copy.** When a slice
  needs a helper/primitive that a sibling reader/collector/store already has (a feed-token
  parser, a URL/HTTP builder, a company-hint/quality mapper, JSON/file scaffolding, etc.),
  **extract it into a shared type and route both call sites through it** — do not copy it. The
  established shared homes: `Radar.Infrastructure.Sources` (e.g. `CollectorCompanyHints`,
  `QueryFeedTarget`), the SEC helpers `SecEdgarUrls`/`SecHttpFetch`, `EvidenceMetadata`,
  `RadarFileStoreJson`, `GracefulFileWriter`. Duplicated primitives silently drift (only one
  copy gets the next fix), and the `radar-architecture-reviewer` has flagged exactly this as a
  recurring MEDIUM (specs 76, 77, 83). Keep genuinely per-source behaviour (e.g. a title-suffix
  strip that applies to one source only) as an explicit per-caller hook rather than forcing it
  into the shared type — share the common core, not the divergent edges.
- **Scoring weights live in config.** Tunable magnitudes/weights live in config (`Radar:Scoring` profiles
  bound onto `ScoringWeights`); the formula *structure* (component shape, direction-sign semantics) stays
  versioned code (`radar-formula-vN`). Don't add a new formula class to change a number — edit/add a profile.
- **Scoring is plural; collection is not.** Stage 6 runs **N strategies over ONE collection pass** (spec 137).
  A strategy is `{ Name, ScoringProfile, SignalTypes? }` under `Radar:Strategies`, with
  `Radar:PrimaryStrategy` naming the primary; an absent/empty list synthesises the single
  current-`Radar:Scoring:Profile` strategy, so every existing config is unaffected. One `ScoringEngine`
  instance **is** one strategy (it resolves its config fingerprint once in the ctor) — build them via
  `IScoringStrategyFactory`, never per-call weights. Rules: collection, the AI directional read, extraction,
  resolution and review run **exactly once** — nothing above the scoring stage may run per strategy; the
  **primary** writes to the existing scores path (and the shared `IScoreRepository`) and is the series the
  weekly report renders, while non-primary strategies get their own repository instance and a
  `strategies/{name}/` scoped path; and `StrategyName` (on `CompanyScoreSnapshot`, trailing + nullable,
  `null` ⇒ primary/legacy) is **not** a fingerprint input. A strategy may additionally declare
  `Radar:Strategies[i].SignalTypes` — the `SignalType`s it consumes (spec 138), its *hypothesis* as opposed
  to its magnitudes; omitted/empty/exhaustive all canonicalise onto `SignalTypeFilter.All`, so "all types"
  is byte-identical to the default and the pins do not move. Unlike `StrategyName` it **is** folded into
  that strategy's fingerprint (the engine composes `filter.Describe(sourceDescriptor.CanonicalDescriptor())`,
  so the gate and the hashed identity cannot drift), and it is applied **after** the spec-136 point-in-time
  read predicate and the spec-85/113 dedupe — to **both** the current and the previous (velocity) window —
  as a pure membership gate: nothing is deleted, evidence chains for consumed signals are intact, and a
  strategy that consumes zero signals gets the same neutral zero-evidence-link snapshot a zero-signal
  company already gets. Known coupling, not yet fixed: `SignalSourceDescriptor` still folds the
  enabled-collector set into every strategy's fingerprint, so enabling a collector re-stamps all strategies
  at once. Splitting *data provenance* from *strategy identity* in the fingerprint is spec 137's recommended
  next slice but is **not yet specced** — 138 (signal-type filter) deliberately does not touch the collector
  set, and it gets cheaper to fix the sooner it is done.
- **Replay is read-only and never forks the scoring path.** `Radar:Replay:Enabled` (spec 139) turns a run into
  a read-only OFFLINE replay *instead of* a pipeline run: it scores the configured strategies across a
  `From`/`To`/`Step` series of historical as-of instants by calling the **same** `ScoringEngine` with a past
  `windowEndUtc` — no second copy of the scoring logic, no collection, no AI read, no report, no price
  (AD-14). It is honest only because spec 136's `CreatedAtUtc <= windowEndUtc` predicate is load-bearing, so
  the replay tests assert that predicate rather than trust it. **The hard invariant is replay ⊆ forward:** a
  replay at as-of D reproduces the forward snapshot at D field-for-field (excluding the per-call minted
  snapshot/link `Guid`s, which forward runs mint too). Replay writes ONLY under its own
  `Radar:ReplayDirectory` root (`{root}/{label}/strategies/{name}/{companyId}/{asOf}.json`, as-of-named so a
  re-run overwrites in place ⇒ idempotent); every strategy — **including the primary** — gets an isolated
  score repository, so the shared repo the weekly report renders and the spec-101/108 forward series are
  never touched. No new fingerprint input; the pins do not move. ~~Known gap~~ **CLOSED by spec 142** — see
  the durable-read-path bullet below: the repositories now hydrate accrued history and the raw-evidence
  schema carries `EvidenceQuality`, so replay finally has something to replay.
- **The repository IS the file store — scoring reads accrued history (spec 142).** Before 142 there were two
  disconnected abstractions over the same facts: `ISignalFileStore`/`IRawEvidenceStore` owned the durable
  format, while `ISignalRepository`/`IEvidenceRepository` resolved to in-memory singletons that started
  **empty every process** — so scoring had *never once* read accrued history, which made spec 136's
  point-in-time predicate near-vacuous and spec 139's replay inert. The recorded reconciliation choice is
  **(b): `FileSignalStore` additionally implements `ISignalRepository` and `FileRawEvidenceStore`
  additionally implements `IEvidenceRepository`** — no third abstraction, no second copy of the persisted
  shape (one record definition, one deserializer, one skip-don't-throw rule set, one hydration cache). Each
  is registered ONCE as a concrete singleton and exposed under both interfaces;
  `AddDurableRadarSignalHistory()` (called from `RadarWorkerServices`, **no config toggle**) `RemoveAll`s the
  in-memory registrations and repoints both interfaces at those same instances. The in-memory repositories
  **stay, unchanged, for tests**, and `AddFileSignalStore`/`AddFileRawEvidenceStore` still do exactly what
  they did. Rules:
  - **Hydration is lazy** (never in the ctor), once per instance, thread-safe, and `TryAdd`-only, so a
    signal/item this process wrote always wins over its own on-disk copy. Writes update disk **and** the
    index, so a write is immediately visible to a later read in the same process. A malformed file is logged
    and skipped, never thrown; `OperationCanceledException` still propagates.
  - **`ISignalRepository.AddAsync` is index-only, deliberately.** It carries no `SignalReview` and the
    durable format requires one (`WriteAsync` has a review→signal provenance guard), so writing a
    review-less file would either break that guard or invent a review. Durability keeps coming from the
    pipeline's existing `ISignalFileStore.WriteAsync` call right after it — append-only (AD-8) and the
    provenance guard are both preserved.
  - **Cross-run duplicate collapse on every durable list read.** `SignalCrossRunDedupe` is the ONE
    definition of the stable identity `(CompanyId, EvidenceId, Type, Direction)` (spec 85's key, extracted),
    shared by `ReadApprovedInWindowAsync` and the repository reads. Survivor rule differs by call site *and
    that difference is load-bearing*: the window read collapses **lowest `SignalId`** because it has already
    applied the known-at predicate, whereas `GetByCompanyAsync`/`GetObservedBetweenAsync` collapse
    **earliest `CreatedAtUtc`, then lowest `SignalId`** because `ScoringEngine` applies
    `CreatedAtUtc <= windowEndUtc` *after* the read — keeping a later-created copy would hide, from a replay
    at T, a signal Radar demonstrably knew about at T.
  - **`EvidenceQuality` is now persisted** (`quality`, trailing + nullable) — it is a v8 formula input, and
    hydrating without it would silently score history differently from how it was scored live. Legacy files
    **recover** it from the `metadata.quality` the collector persisted all along, via the shared
    `EvidenceQualityParser` — the *exact* rule `CollectedEvidenceMapper` applied at collection time, so this
    reproduces the real value rather than defaulting. Neither present ⇒ `Unknown`, which is exactly what the
    mapper itself produces for quality-less evidence and whose weight (`QualityUnknown` 0.40) sits **below**
    Medium 0.60 / High 0.85 / PrimarySource 1.00 — it never flatters a score. Legacy null is **never** mapped
    to Medium or higher. `summary` is persisted too (trailing, nullable, omitted when null so real files are
    byte-unchanged) so the round-trip is lossless rather than green by accident, and `sourceType` parses back
    from its snake_case token via a table built *from* the enum (every member round-trips by construction);
    an unparseable value degrades the **file** (log + skip), never the source type, because `SourceType` feeds
    attention breadth/diversity. `EvidenceItem.MetadataJson` is re-composed through the shared
    `EvidenceMetadata.Compose` the mapper authors it with, so the envelope is byte-identical **by
    construction**.
  - **The invariant, asserted:** scoring a window against the hydrated durable store is field-for-field
    identical to scoring the same signals held in memory (excluding the per-call minted snapshot/link
    `Guid`s) — mirroring replay ⊆ forward. No scoring change, no formula bump, **no fingerprint input**;
    the pins do not move.
  - **Real behaviour change:** `AddIfNewAsync` now returns `false` for evidence collected in a **previous**
    run, so re-running collection no longer re-extracts signals from already-seen evidence. That is the
    idempotency the spec asked for, and it changes how a live baseline run behaves.
  - **Measured against the live store (2026-07-26), and it is not comfortable:** 49,454 signals / 6,044
    evidence items; signals span 2006-02→2026-07 (observed) over 44 companies, evidence collected
    2026-06-30→2026-07-26. Only **10.5 % of signals' `EvidenceId`s resolve** on disk. Cause: the mapper mints
    a fresh evidence `Guid` per run while raw files are keyed by `contentHash`, so a re-collected item's new
    id was never persisted while its signals were. The store therefore holds ~9.2× content-equivalent
    duplication that spec 85's key **cannot** collapse (the duplication is in *evidence* identity, not signal
    identity) — Radar is protected from 9× score inflation only by the accident that those duplicates'
    evidence is unresolvable and `ScoringEngine` drops them. ~~Do not backfill evidence without fixing
    evidence identity first (spec 141)~~ — the evidence-identity fix is **spec 145** (not 141, which is
    *strategy* identity), and it is now **done, forward only**: new evidence gets a content-derived id, so
    the duplication stops accruing. What remains true, and is the standing rule: **do not backfill or rewrite
    the accrued 89.5 %.** 145 deliberately left history exactly as it is, so retro-healing resolution would
    still turn the live 30-day window's 1.03× scored set (2,618 signals) into a 4.6× one (12,145). 142 and
    145 both heal going forward and neither touches history.
- **Evidence identity is content-derived (spec 145) — the fix that made spec 85's key non-vacuous.**
  `CollectedEvidenceMapper` minted `Guid.NewGuid()` per run while `FileRawEvidenceStore` path-keyed files on
  `contentHash`, so the id a signal referenced was unrelated to the id the file carried: resolution failed
  (10.5 %) *and* the spec-85 dedupe key `(CompanyId, EvidenceId, Type, Direction)` — which **contains**
  evidence identity — could never collapse identity duplication (measured **1.000×** key-collapse vs
  **9.213×** content-collapse over 49,454 signals). `EvidenceIdentity.ForContentHash` now derives the id from
  the namespaced canonical string `"radar:evidence:" + contentHash`, through the shared
  `DeterministicGuid.FromCanonicalString` that `LocalFileCompanySeedSource` was **extracted onto** rather than
  copied (reuse-over-copy; the seed source keeps its own `companyId|kind|value` canonicalisation, and its
  produced Guids are byte-identical — pinned by value). Rules:
  - **Identity is the normalized title+body hash ALONE.** Explicitly excluded: `CollectedAt`, `PublishedAt`,
    run id, any minted id, collector/source name, source URL (hence every volatile query parameter and
    tracking token), the metadata bag, company hints, and `SourceType`.
  - **Cross-collector: the same content from two collectors is ONE evidence record**, because identical
    normalized content is one *fact* and two collectors finding it is two retrieval paths, not two facts.
    Provenance is **not** collapsed — every contributing source's own raw file stays on disk under its own
    `{sourceTypeFolder}/{yyyy}/{MM}/{contentHash}.json` (insert-only, AD-1); only the identity **index**
    collapses, deterministically by ordinal path order, and hydration now **reports** that collapse in its own
    counter, separate from unreadable-file skips (two counters, not one — the duplication rate and data loss
    mean different things).
  - **Scores do not rise, and the reason is structural, not directional.** "Lower breadth ⇒ lower score" is
    *not* universally true: `OpportunityScore` consumes `AttentionScore` as an **inverse** discount, so a
    lower attention would *raise* opportunity. It is never exercised because `AddIfNewAsync` has always
    rejected a second item with an already-seen content hash, so at most one record per distinct content
    could ever be persisted or resolved — the breadth of a set of identical copies was already exactly 1
    *before* this slice. 145 changes **which id** that one record carries, not how many there are. Asserted:
    N runs over identical content yield ONE scored signal, and the duplicated fixture scores **equal** to the
    single-copy fixture component-for-component. **Measured, not just argued** (spec-139 read-only replay at
    as-of 2026-07-26 over the live store, run on `origin/main` and on this branch): all **43** companies came
    back field-for-field identical excluding the per-call minted snapshot/link `Guid`s — **703** evidence links
    on both sides, **0** components risen, **0** fallen, same `radar-scoring-fp-97207902fd70` stamp.
  - **Accrued history: left as-is, dedupe forward only** (the chosen option). Nothing deleted, nothing
    rewritten, no migration, no backfill, no supersede marker. Legacy evidence keeps its legacy ids and legacy
    signals keep their references, so no historical series moves.
  - **The dropped-signal warning is aggregated, not silenced.** `ScoringEngine` emitted one Warning per
    dropped signal (~9,500 per run **per strategy**); since the legacy residue deliberately survives, it is now
    **one Warning per company** carrying the dropped count *and* the distinct-evidence-id count, with per-signal
    detail at Debug. Measured over the same live replay: **13,625 → 43** warning lines (one per company, a 317×
    reduction) with the total dropped count preserved in aggregate rather than lost.
  - **No fingerprint move**: no `ScoringConfigVersion` input changed, no `_formula.Version` bump, no
    `KeywordSignalExtractor.RuleSetVersion` bump. The pins do not move.
- Prefer deterministic code before AI. Use typed records and validated structured outputs.
- Store all timestamps in UTC. IDs are `Guid` unless there is a strong reason otherwise.
- AI outputs must be typed and validated before persistence. If AI confidence is low,
  persist the evidence but do not create high-confidence signals.

### Output language (hard rule)

Radar must never produce financial advice. Do not emit "buy", "sell", "guaranteed upside",
or "safe bet". Allowed labels only: `Investigate`, `Watch`, `Ignore`, `Needs more evidence`,
`Thesis improving`, `Thesis deteriorating`. (`Ignore` was re-added per the collector-driven
master spec — see AD-9. The five non-`Ignore` labels remain valid.)

### Sub-agents

- **`radar-coder`** — implements specs (the coder in the Step 3 loop).
- **`radar-code-reviewer`** — reviews code changes; returns `APPROVED` or `ISSUES FOUND`
  (the reviewer in the Step 3 loop).
- **`radar-work-planner`** — splits master specs into small implementation specs in
  `docs/next/` (planning, not part of the per-task loop).
- **`radar-architecture-reviewer`** — read-only, ad-hoc audit of the *whole* codebase for
  cross-slice drift (layering, DI/naming/error-handling consistency, duplication, provenance
  erosion). Run every few merged slices to checkpoint the trunk; not part of the per-task loop.
- **`radar-signal-reviewer`** / **`radar-skeptic-reviewer`** — *runtime pipeline* reviewers
  that judge extracted signals and emerging theses for evidence quality and hype. These are
  domain reviewers invoked inside the Radar pipeline, **not** the Step 3 code-review loop.

### Spec implementation checklist

When implementing a spec that replaces existing functionality:

1. Identify all code paths being replaced.
2. Update or remove tests for the old code paths.
3. Ensure tests exercise the new production path.
4. Delete deprecated code rather than leaving it dormant.
5. Update this CLAUDE.md if the architecture changes.
6. A tunable **magnitude/weight** change is now a **config edit** (a new/edited `Radar:Scoring` profile bound
   onto `ScoringWeights`) — it needs **no code version bump**, and the `ScoringConfigVersion` fingerprint
   re-stamps automatically. The only remaining code-version obligation is bumping `_formula.Version` (a new
   `radar-formula-vN` class) when the formula **structure/shape** changes (AD-6). See AD-10 (as amended).
7. A scoring-affecting **extractor rule-STRUCTURE** change (the `KeywordSignalExtractor` phrase→direction/strength
   table shape) bumps `KeywordSignalExtractor.RuleSetVersion` (parallel to `_formula.Version`) — it is folded into
   the `ScoringConfigVersion` fingerprint via `SignalSourceDescriptor` (spec 95, AD-10 amended). The
   **enabled-collector set** is captured automatically by that same fingerprint, so enabling/disabling a collector
   needs **no** bump — it re-stamps on its own. The **insider buy/sell materiality tiers + cluster boost** are now
   config too (`Radar:Insider` profiles bound onto `InsiderMaterialityWeights`, default == spec 93) and are hashed
   into that fingerprint **by value** (spec 96, AD-10 amended) — so a tier **magnitude** change is a **config edit**
   needing **no** `RuleSetVersion` bump; only a rule **structure** change bumps `RuleSetVersion`.
